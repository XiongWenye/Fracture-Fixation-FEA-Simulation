\section{Introduction}

In fracture repair processes, as splints or internal fixators gradually reduce load-bearing, the fracture region begins to regain stress-bearing capacity. This project simulates how decreasing splint stiffness (or increasing fracture surface bonding strength) in a "bone+splint" system affects stress redistribution during healing, helping to understand the biomechanical phenomenon of "stress transfer". The study focuses on the influence of varying fixator stiffness on stress distribution and fracture gap strain during the healing process, employing Finite Element Analysis (FEA).

\section{Overview of existing work}

Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a powerful computational tool extensively used in biomechanics to simulate and analyze the behavior of biological structures under various conditions. In orthopedics, FEA plays a crucial role in understanding fracture mechanics, designing and optimizing implants, and predicting the outcomes of fracture fixation strategies \citep{lewis2021finite}. Traditional methods for evaluating fracture treatments, such as in vitro experiments and clinical trials, often face limitations in terms of cost, time, and the ability to perform detailed parametric studies. FEA offers a complementary approach, allowing for the detailed examination of stress and strain distributions within bone-implant constructs.

A key aspect of fracture healing is the concept of "stress shielding," where a rigid fixation device bears a significant portion of the load, reducing the mechanical stimulus to the healing bone. While some stress shielding is necessary for initial stability, excessive shielding can delay or impair bone healing by inhibiting the formation of callus and its subsequent remodeling. Conversely, overly flexible fixation can lead to excessive motion at the fracture site, potentially resulting in non-union. Therefore, understanding the optimal mechanical environment for fracture healing is critical.

Recent research has focused on developing computational models that can simulate the mechanobiological processes of fracture healing. These models often incorporate time-dependent material properties for the healing callus and consider the influence of mechanical stimuli, such as strain or stress, on tissue differentiation \citep{morgan2024novel}. Parametric studies using FEA can investigate how factors like fixator stiffness, fracture gap size, and loading conditions affect the stress transfer mechanism from the fixator to the bone as healing progresses. This project aligns with this direction by specifically investigating how different fixator stiffnesses influence stress distribution and fracture gap strain over a simulated healing period.

We use Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to model stress redistribution during fracture healing, incorporating time-dependent material properties and parametric studies of fixator stiffness.

\subsection{Problem Definition}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Type}: Non-homogeneous elastic body under quasi-static load with time-varying material properties (elastic modulus of callus)
  \item \textbf{Model}: 2D plane stress "bone+fixator" system with a healing fracture gap (callus) using quadrilateral elements
  \item \textbf{Features}: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Simulation of stress transfer from fixator to bone tissue as callus stiffness increases
    \item Parametric study of different fixator stiffness conditions
    \item Quantitative evaluation of stress shielding effects
    \item Monitoring of fracture gap strain evolution
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mathematical Model}

\subsubsection{Mechanical Framework}

The linear elasticity problem with time-dependent parameters is formulated as:

\[
\bm{\sigma}^{(t)} = \mathbf{D}^{(t)}\bm{\varepsilon}
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\bm{\sigma}^{(t)}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor at time $t$
  \item $\bm{\varepsilon}$ is the small strain tensor ($\varepsilon_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}(u_{i,j} + u_{j,i})$)
  \item $\mathbf{D}^{(t)}$ is the constitutive matrix for plane stress:
  \[
  \mathbf{D} = \frac{E}{1-\nu^2}\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & \nu & 0 \\
  \nu & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & \frac{1-\nu}{2}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Material Evolution}
The material properties evolve as follows:
\begin{align*}
  \text{Bone tissue} & : E_{bone} = 18 \text{ GPa}, \nu = 0.3 \text{ (constant)} \\
  \text{Fixator}     & : E_{fixator} \in \{35, 70, 140\} \text{ GPa (parametric study)} \\
  \text{Callus}      & : E_{callus}^{(t)} = E_0 + \frac{t}{t_{max}}(E_{final}-E_0) \\
                     & \text{where } E_0 = 0.1 \text{ GPa}, E_{final} = 18 \text{ GPa}
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Fracture Interface Modeling}
The fracture gap is modeled as a region with:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Initial width $w_{frac} = 10$ mm centered in the bone
  \item Time-dependent material properties representing biological healing
  \item Strain calculation using displacement differences across the gap:
  \[
  \varepsilon_{gap} = \frac{\Delta u}{L_{gap}}
  \]
  where $L_{gap}$ is the current gap width
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Finite Element Implementation}

\subsubsection{Element Formulation}

The implementation uses bilinear quadrilateral elements (Q4) with:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Shape functions in natural coordinates ($\xi,\eta$):
  \[
  N_i(\xi,\eta) = \frac{1}{4}(1+\xi_i\xi)(1+\eta_i\eta), \quad \xi_i,\eta_i \in \{-1,1\}
  \]
  \item Strain-displacement matrix $\mathbf{B}$:
  \[
  \mathbf{B} = \begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial N_1}{\partial x} & 0 & \cdots & \frac{\partial N_4}{\partial x} & 0 \\
  0 & \frac{\partial N_1}{\partial y} & \cdots & 0 & \frac{\partial N_4}{\partial y} \\
  \frac{\partial N_1}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial N_1}{\partial x} & \cdots & \frac{\partial N_4}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial N_4}{\partial x}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  \item Element stiffness matrix computed using 2Ã—2 Gauss quadrature:
  \[
  \mathbf{k}^e = \sum_{i=1}^2\sum_{j=1}^2 w_iw_j\mathbf{B}^T(\xi_i,\eta_j)\mathbf{D}\mathbf{B}(\xi_i,\eta_j)|\mathbf{J}(\xi_i,\eta_j)|
  \]
  with integration points at $\xi_i,\eta_j = \pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ and weights $w_i=w_j=1$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Postprocessing}

Key analysis metrics include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Stress shielding ratio: $\frac{\sigma_{fixator}}{\sigma_{bone}}$
  \item Fracture gap strain evolution
  \item Stress distribution in callus region
  \item Load transfer between fixator and bone
\end{itemize}

Visualization includes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Contour plots of von Mises stress
  \item Time histories of average stresses
  \item Comparative plots across parameter studies
\end{itemize}


\section{Your own contribution}

Our primary contribution lies in the development and application of a parametric FEA model to investigate the influence of fixator stiffness on stress transfer and fracture gap mechanics during simulated bone healing. Key aspects of our contribution include:

\subsection{Parametric Study of Fixator Stiffness}
We systematically varied the Young's modulus of the fixator to represent three distinct clinical scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Flexible Fixator}: $E_{fixator} = 35$ GPa (e.g., less rigid material or design)
  \item \textbf{Standard Fixator}: $E_{fixator} = 70$ GPa (e.g., typical aluminum or titanium alloy)
  \item \textbf{Rigid Fixator}: $E_{fixator} = 140$ GPa (e.g., stiffer material or more robust design)
\end{itemize}
This allows for a direct comparison of how fixator stiffness affects the biomechanical environment of the healing fracture.

\subsection{Time-Dependent Callus Healing Model}
We implemented a progressive healing model where the Young's modulus of the callus ($E_{callus}$) increases linearly over 20 simulated time steps, from an initial soft tissue stiffness ($E_{callus}^{initial} = 0.1$ GPa) to that of mature bone ($E_{callus}^{final} = 18$ GPa). This simulates the gradual stiffening of the fracture site during the healing process.

\subsection{Quantitative Analysis of Biomechanical Parameters}
For each simulation step and fixator type, we calculated and tracked key biomechanical indicators:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Average Von Mises Stress}: Calculated separately for the bone, callus, and fixator regions. This helps quantify stress distribution and the phenomenon of stress shielding.
  \item \textbf{Fracture Gap Strain}: The average axial strain across the callus region, a critical factor influencing tissue differentiation and healing outcome.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Development of a Reusable FEA Simulation Script}
We developed a Python script utilizing NumPy for numerical computations and Matplotlib for visualization. The script automates:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mesh generation for the 2D bone-fixator-callus model.
  \item Material property assignment and time-dependent updates for the callus.
  \item Assembly of global stiffness matrix and application of boundary conditions/loads.
  \item Solution for displacements and calculation of stresses and strains.
  \item Post-processing to calculate average stresses and gap strain.
  \item Generation of visualizations, including:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Von Mises stress contour plots at each healing step.
          \item Plots showing the evolution of average stresses in bone, callus, and fixator over time.
          \item Plots showing the evolution of fracture gap strain over time.
          \item Comparative plots summarizing final stress distributions and gap strain evolution across different fixator stiffnesses.
        \end{itemize}
  \item Export of detailed and summary results to CSV files for further analysis.
\end{itemize}
This framework allows for efficient exploration of different parameters and scenarios.

\section{Numerical results}

The simulations were run for three fixator stiffness configurations: Flexible (35 GPa), Standard (70 GPa), and Rigid (140 GPa). The healing process was simulated over 20 steps, with the callus stiffness progressively increasing. The table below summarizes the key biomechanical parameters at the final healing step (step 20), where the callus has reached the stiffness of mature bone.

\end{table}

\subsection{Interpretation of Results}

\textbf{Stress Distribution}:
As fixator stiffness increases from Flexible to Rigid:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The stress borne by the \textbf{fixator} increases significantly (48.89 MPa to 77.85 MPa). This is expected, as a stiffer fixator takes up more of the applied load.
  \item The stress experienced by the \textbf{bone} decreases (25.46 MPa to 11.30 MPa). This demonstrates increased stress shielding with more rigid fixation.
  \item Similarly, the stress in the fully matured \textbf{callus} also decreases (25.35 MPa to 10.23 MPa), following the trend of the bone.
\end{itemize}
These results quantitatively illustrate the stress shielding effect. While the simulation ends with a fully matured callus, during the healing process, the stress experienced by the developing callus would be crucial for mechanotransduction.

\textbf{Fracture Gap Strain}:
The final axial strain across the fracture gap (now mature callus) decreases as fixator stiffness increases (1.41 $\mu\varepsilon$ for Flexible, 0.94 $\mu\varepsilon$ for Standard, and 0.57 $\mu\varepsilon$ for Rigid). This indicates that more rigid fixation leads to less deformation at the fracture site. The magnitude of interfragmentary strain is a critical factor in determining the pathway of bone healing (e.g., direct vs. indirect healing, formation of different tissue types). The observed strains are very small, which is expected for a fully healed bone under the simulated load. The evolution of this strain during earlier healing phases (when callus is softer) would be more indicative of the healing quality.

The detailed evolution of these parameters over the 20 healing steps, along with stress contour plots, are available in the generated output files and visualizations from the Python script. These provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic changes occurring during the simulated healing process. For instance, plots of "Stress Shielding Effect" would show how the proportion of load carried by the fixator versus the bone/callus changes as the callus matures for each fixator type. Similarly, "Fracture Gap Strain Evolution" plots would depict how strain at the fracture site changes throughout the healing process.

\section{Conclusion}
This project successfully developed and utilized a 2D finite element model to simulate the biomechanics of fracture healing under different fixator stiffnesses. The parametric study demonstrated that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Increasing fixator stiffness leads to higher stress concentrations in the fixator itself and lower stresses in the bone and healing callus, illustrating the stress shielding phenomenon.
  \item More rigid fixators result in lower fracture gap strains throughout the simulated healing process.
\end{itemize}
These findings align with established biomechanical principles. The flexible fixator allowed for greater load sharing with the bone and callus, potentially promoting more robust healing, while the rigid fixator provided maximum stability but also the most significant stress shielding. The standard fixator offered an intermediate response.

The developed Python scriptprovides a reusable framework for such simulations, allowing for the generation of detailed stress contours, stress/strain evolution plots, and comparative analyses. Figure \ref{fig:parametric_comparison} visually summarizes the key differences observed across the fixator types at the end of the simulated healing period.

Future work could expand this model to 3D, incorporate more complex material models for bone and callus (e.g., anisotropic, viscoelastic), and integrate mechanobiological rules to simulate tissue differentiation directly. Nevertheless, the current model serves as a valuable tool for understanding the fundamental interplay between fixator mechanics and the fracture healing environment.
